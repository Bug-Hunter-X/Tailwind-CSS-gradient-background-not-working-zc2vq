# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds and how to solve it.

## Problem

The gradient background is not rendering correctly using the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility. The code seems correct, but the expected gradient is not visible. This can be caused by several factors:

1. **Missing or incorrect Tailwind directives:** The `@tailwind` directives in your CSS file might be missing or incorrectly placed.
2. **Conflicting CSS rules:** Other CSS rules might be overriding the Tailwind styles.
3. **Incorrect usage of gradient utilities:** The gradient utility classes might be used incorrectly.

## Solution

The solution shows how to correctly implement gradient backgrounds and the key points to avoid such problems.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server. You'll notice the gradient background is not displaying correctly.
4. Then switch over to the bugSolution.js to see how it's fixed.

## Key points

- Ensure that the `@tailwind` directives are correctly added in your `tailwind.config.js` and also imported in your CSS file. 
- Check for any conflicting CSS rules that might be overriding the Tailwind styles.
- Make sure to use the correct gradient utilities.
- Sometimes clearing the browser cache can resolve the issue.
